## 📐 Financial Logic

### Step 1: Project Current Portfolio
Each asset grows using compound interest:
```
Future Value = Present Value × (1 + rate)^years
```

### Step 2: Inflation-Adjust the Target
```
Adjusted Target = Target × (1 + 0.06)^years
```

### Step 3: Calculate Gap
```
Gap = Adjusted Target − Total Projected Portfolio
```

### Step 4: Calculate Monthly SIP (FV of Annuity)
```
Monthly SIP = Gap × (r/12) / [(1 + r/12)^months − 1]
```
Where r = 12% (equity growth rate)

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**"Gradle sync failed"** → Check your internet connection; Gradle needs to download dependencies (~50MB)

**"SDK not found"** → In Android Studio: `Tools → SDK Manager` → Install Android SDK 34

**"Cannot install APK"** → Enable "Unknown sources" in phone Settings → Security
